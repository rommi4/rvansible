These lines in /etc/nsswitch.conf:
#hosts:     db files nisplus nis dns
hosts:      files mdns4_minimal dns [NOTFOUND=return] myhostname mymachines

First of all divide configuration into three steps:
0. configuration for screen (1920x1080)
1. pre-configuration role (put necessary files: private ssh key, vim configuration, terminator configurations and etc)
2. Download and install necessary packages, configure them
3. Post-installation - prepare wg environment: puppet-dev, hiera-backend, stash
(!!!) and what I want to admit: there might be change in structure.
(No PycharmProject directory, as I'll use Atom instead)

0. (!!!) VPN

1. Pycharm
    Downdload and install pycharm

(set environment)
2. svn checkout
3. git clone
!!! git config
4. ssh key (private)

5. cinnamon configurations ()
